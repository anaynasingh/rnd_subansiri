# AI-Based Framework to analyse and predict the flow of mid-line channel of Subansiri River using remote sensing and GIS

This was the research project I worked on during the R&D course in my sixth semester which is still ongoing. Me and my team worked on this project for a time period of 5 months.

Subansiri river is known to change its course frequently. This causes a tremendous amount of loss of lives, fertile agricultural land and money each year. High amounts of money and lives can be saved by accurate prediction of flood prone areas around Subansiri river. We worked to analyze the migration pattern of mid-line channel of the Subansiri river in Assam from 2000-2020 and predict its future flow. We trained a machine learning model using Random Forest Regression to predict the migration in the year of 2021 over 20 cross sections of the mid-line channel of the river. Validation testing for each of the 20 cross sections was also done. 

We are currently still working on this research project to improve its accuracy by implementing Neural Networks. The tools and technologies involved in this project are Google Earth Engine, QGIS, Google Colaboratory, Remote Sensing and GIS.
